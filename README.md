# Lending Club Case study 
> The primary objective of this exercise is to assist Lending Club in mitigating credit losses. This challenge arises from two potential scenarios:
Identifying applicants likely to repay their loans is crucial, as they can generate profits for the company through interest payments. Rejecting such applicants would result in a loss of potential business.
On the other hand, approving loans for applicants not likely to repay and at risk of default can lead to substantial financial losses for the company.

* [General Info](The objective is to pinpoint applicants at risk of defaulting on loans, enabling a reduction in credit losses.)
* [Technologies Used](#Python, Matplotlib,Pandas,Seaborn)
* [Conclusions](Applicants with annual incomes less than $40,000 have a higher likelihood of defaulting. The company should consider setting maximum loan amounts based on income levels to ensure affordability for borrowers.
Verified loan applicants are defaulting more than those who are not verified. The company should review its verification process to ensure its effectiveness.
The company should anticipate increased demand during Q4 period and ensure efficient processing to meet customer needs.)
